        (NON-FUNCTIONAL PLACEHOLDER - REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT FURTHER DEVELOPMENT)
        This method is intended to add directed edges (morphisms) to the graph if 
        one configuration's phi vector (φ_source) can be transformed into another's 
        (φ_target) by a given symmetry operator S (potentially associated with the 
        target's g_type or some other defined transformation rule).
        E.g., S[g'] φ_source ≈ φ_target.

        **Current Status: This method is a placeholder and NOT functional.**

        **Conceptual Requirements for Implementation:**
        1.  **Access to Full Phi Vectors:** The `CategoricalStructure` currently stores
            simplified configuration data (e.g., g_type and an ID). To perform 
            transformations, this method would need access to the actual phi vectors 
            (e.g., QuTiP Qobjs or JAX arrays) for all configurations.
        2.  **Defined Set of Morphism-Inducing Operators (S_morph):** A clear definition 
            of the set of operators S_morph that constitute valid morphisms in the 
            category C is needed. `s_operator_func` is a placeholder for a function
            that could provide such operators (e.g., based on g_types or other criteria).
        3.  **Transformation Logic:** How S_morph acts on phi vectors.
        4.  **Comparison Logic:** A robust way to compare the transformed phi_source with 
            all other phi_target vectors in the configuration space, considering numerical 
            precision (the `threshold` argument).
        5.  **Computational Cost:** For a large number of configurations and operators, this 
            can be computationally intensive (potentially N_configs * N_ops_morph * N_configs comparisons).

        Args:
            s_operator_func (callable): (Placeholder) A function that would take relevant parameters

                                        a QuTiP/JAX symmetry operator S representing a morphism.
